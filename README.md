# 😴 Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time drowsiness detection system using OpenCV and deep learning to alert drivers and prevent accidents due to fatigue.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time eye monitoring via webcam
- Eye aspect ratio (EAR) based drowsiness detection
- Sound alert when drowsiness is detected
- Easy-to-use interface
- Lightweight and runs locally

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 👁
- dlib (for facial landmarks)
- NumPy
- scipy
- playsound (for alert)
- imutils

## 📷 How It Works

1. The webcam captures video frames.
2. Facial landmarks are detected using dlib.
3. Eye aspect ratio (EAR) is calculated.
4. If eyes remain closed for a defined thresho
